The microcontroller laboratory exercises are designed to introduce the basics of
interfacing and controlling microcontrollers through C and assembly programs,
which are required for you to build a micromouse in the second term of this
module.

There will be a short [Getting Started](Start/getting-started.html) session and this will be followed by four exercises on the following topics:

- Exercise 1: Keyboard interrupt (10 marks) [[HTML](Exercise1/exercise1.html),[PDF](Exercise1/exercise1.pdf),[docx](Exercise1/exercise1.html)]
- Exercise 2: Analogue to digital conversion (ADC) (6 marks) ([HTML](Exercise2/exercise2.html),[PDF](Exercise2/exercise2.pdf),[docx](Exercise2/exercise2.docx)]
- Exercise 3: Timer/pulse-width modulation (PWM) (14 marks) [[HTML](Exercise3/exercise3.html),[PDF](Exercise3/exercise3.pdf),[docx](Exercise3/exercise3.docx)]
- Exercise 4: [Version Control with Git](https://cpjobling.github.io/eg-252-git-novice-2020/) (5 marks) -- needed prior to working on the micromouse code.

You would normally work in pairs and share the various tasks required with your partner, but this year, because of Covid-19, you will work on these exercises as an individual.
It is advised to spend some time prior to the timetabled laboratory sessions on
preparing designs, leaving the laboratory time for essential testing and
consultation. You should complete the end-of-exercise assessment, which requires you to upload upload a copy of your code, at the end of each laboratory exercise.
