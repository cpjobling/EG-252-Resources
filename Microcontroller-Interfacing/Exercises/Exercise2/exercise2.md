## I. Overview

For this lab exercise you are provided a sample ADC assembly program given in
the appendix. An electronic version of the program is available on the
Blackboard site. The program uses interrupt generated by push buttons to
trigger an ADC process on the MC9S08AW60 evaluation board. You are to carry out
the following two tasks with this exercise:

- Use the sample program to practice on pushbutton with interrupt mechanism and
ADC process with the evaluation board.
- Design an equivalent program in C language which can perform the same keyboard
interrupt and ADC processing functions as provided by the example assembly program.

This exercise is worth 6 marks. For this exercise you need only demonstrate your
program with the evaluation board to _Dr Chris Jobling by Monday, 8
December 2013_. No report is needed.
