# README

This folder contains Dr Davies' demo micro mouse programme [tachoavoid.c](https://github.com/cpjobling/EG-252-Resources/blob/master/Micromouse/tacho-avoid/tachoavoid.c) which demonstrates and tests obstacle avoidance for a newly born mouse.

It was developed for the EG-252 Group Design Exercise.

## Contents

* [tachoavoid.c](https://github.com/cpjobling/EG-252-Resources/blob/master/Micromouse/tacho-avoid/tachoavoid.c) -- the demonstration of onstacle avoidance with tachometer feedback for speed control.
* [tachoavoid.ipynb](https://github.com/cpjobling/EG-252-Resources/blob/master/Micromouse/tacho-avoid/tachoavoid.ipynb) --Documentation for `tachoavoid.c` which attempts to explain the structure of a typical C-programme for a microcontroller. Can be presented as a slide show with Jupyter Notebooks and the Rise plugin.
